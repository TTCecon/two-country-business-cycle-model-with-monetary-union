# two-country-business-cycle-model-with-monetary-union
I extended the two country business cycle model to reproduce the actual situation of EU countries by introducing a monetary union and two independent government agencies. This model is an extension of Matteo Iacoviello and Raoul Minetti (2006). If there is any model Feel free to ask me any related questions.
